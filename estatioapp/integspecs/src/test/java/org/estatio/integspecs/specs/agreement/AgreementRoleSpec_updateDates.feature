Feature: Update the start/end dates of an existing AgreementRole

  The start and end dates of an AgreementRole may be updated, however they 
  cannot be moved beyond bounds of the immediate predecessor or successor.
  
  In other words, the start date of a role can move earlier, but not earlier 
  than the start date of any predecessor.

  Similarly, the end date of a role can move later, but not later 
  than the end date of any successor.


  Background:
    Given there is a lease "OXF-PRET-004"
    And   there is a party "PRET"

    And   I want to update the dates on the indicated agreement role
    
    When  I invoke the action, start date "2013-4-1", end date "2014-8-31"
     
    Then  the lease's roles collection should contain:
