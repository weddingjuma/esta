Feature: Remove an existing role, replacing with its predecessor or successor 

  Roles must always be contiguous.  If a role is replaced, then the dates that it occupied
  must be taken up either by its predecessor or its successor.


  Background:
    Given there is a lease "OXF-PRET-004"
    And   there is a party "PRET" 


  @integration
  Scenario: Cannot replace if no successor or predecessor
  
    Given the lease's roles collection contains:
          | type     | start date | end date | party  | agreement    | indicated |
          | Tenant   | null       | null     | PRET   | OXF-PRET-004 | *         |
    And   I want to replace the indicated agreement role with a successor or predecessor
    
    When  I attempt to invoke the action 
    
    Then  the action is disabled with message "No predecessor or successor to replace"
    And   the lease's roles collection should contain:
          | type     | start date | end date | party  | agreement    |
          | Tenant   | null       | 2013-4-1 | PRET   | OXF-PRET-004 |


  @integration
  Scenario: Can replace if has successor, though no predecessor
    Given the lease's roles collection contains:
          | type     | start date | end date | party  | agreement    | indicated |

          | Tenant   | 2010-3-1   | 2013-4-1 | PRET   | OXF-PRET-004 | *         |
    When  I want to replace the indicated agreement role with a successor or predecessor
    
    Then  the direction string parameter defaults to "successor"
    And   the direction string parameter choices is only "successor"
    
    When  I invoke the action with direction as "successor"
    
    Then  the lease's roles collection should contain:
          | type     | start date | end date | party  | agreement    |
          | Tenant   | 2010-3-1   | 2015-9-1 | POISON | OXF-PRET-004 |
