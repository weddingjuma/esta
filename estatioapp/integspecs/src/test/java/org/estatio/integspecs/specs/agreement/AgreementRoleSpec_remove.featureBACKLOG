Feature: Remove the last role within an Agreement's role collection

  This is the corollary of the Agreement's addRole action.

  Background:
    Given there is a lease "OXF-PRET-004"
    And   there is a party "PRET" 


  @integration
  Scenario: Remove last role
    Given the lease's roles collection contains:
          | type     | start date | end date | party  | agreement    | indicated |
          | Tenant   | null       | null     | PRET   | OXF-PRET-004 | *         |
          
    When  I want to remove the indicated agreement role
    And   I invoke the action
    
    Then  the lease's roles collection should contain:
          | type     | start date | end date | party  | agreement    |


  @integration
  Scenario: Remove last role (when different role types)
  
    Given the lease's roles collection contains:
          | type     | start date | end date | party  | agreement    | indicated |
          | Landlord | 2013-4-1   | null     | POISON | OXF-PRET-004 |           |
          | Tenant   | null       | null     | PRET   | OXF-PRET-004 | *         |
          
    When  I want to remove the indicated agreement role
    And   I invoke the action
    
    Then  the lease's roles collection should contain:
          | type     | start date | end date | party  | agreement    |
          | Landlord | 2013-4-1   | null     | POISON | OXF-PRET-004 | 


  @integration
  Scenario: Cannot remove role if more than one role of existing type
  
    Given the lease's roles collection contains:
          | type     | start date | end date | party  | agreement    | indicated |
          | Landlord | 2013-4-1   | null     | POISON | OXF-PRET-004 | 
          | Landlord | null       | 2013-4-1 | PRET   | OXF-PRET-004 | *         |

    When  I want to remove the indicated agreement role
    And   I attempt to invoke the action
          
    Then  the action is disabled with message "Only the first role of any type can be explicitly removed" 
    And   the lease's roles collection should contain:
          | type     | start date | end date | party  | agreement    |
          | Landlord | 2013-4-1   | null     | POISON | OXF-PRET-004 | 
          | Landlord | null       | 2013-4-1 | PRET   | OXF-PRET-004 | *         |
